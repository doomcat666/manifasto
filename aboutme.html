    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
    <h3>1993   massacre</h3>
    <p>hello there to who stumbled upon my blog.<br>
    Welcome i cant say my real name but you can call me Vampyro <br>
    I am 20 years old from tunisia <br>
    i am student<br>
    i am music producer programmer serialkiller<br>
    my life is just pain and suffering i have evrything i could ever want<br>
    yet i feel empty i feel like i dont belong here i felt i owed something to the world, and
    then no matter what i did it just didn't seem like enough.
    i would do nothing and consequently i would feel horrible about myself. and
    then i started realizing that maybe it wasn't me
    that owed this world something, it was the world that owed something to me.
    for all the shit i have been through, for everything i felt that
    i never imagined it would be possible to feel, maybe the world
    owed me some fucking compensation for making me feel like the
    loneliest person to ever live.so i made this blog to busy myself from life until its ended
i hope you will find calm and peace in your road to death for it is solution to unsolved problems
</p>
